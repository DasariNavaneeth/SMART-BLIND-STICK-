#  Smart Blind Stick for Visually Impaired Individuals  
---
##  Overview  

The **Smart Blind Stick** is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely.  
It integrates multiple sensors to detect obstacles, measure depth, detect falls, and send GPS location alerts to family members via **Twilio SMS**.  
The stick provides real-time feedback through a **buzzer**, ensuring both safety and independence.

##  Features  

### ðŸ”¹ Obstacle Detection  
- Ultrasonic sensor detects nearby obstacles and alerts the user through a buzzer.  

### ðŸ”¹ Depth Detection  
- Another ultrasonic sensor measures the depth of drop-offs or steps to prevent falls.  

### ðŸ”¹ Fall Detection with Delay  
- The gyroscope detects if the user falls.  
- After a **10-second delay**, the GPS module sends the userâ€™s location to family members via **Twilio SMS**.  
- The delay allows the user to cancel **false alarms**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Manual Location Alert  
- Pressing the **push button** sends the userâ€™s GPS location immediately via **Twilio SMS**.  

### ðŸ”¹ GPS Fallback via IP  
- If GPS fails to get a fix, the system uses **IP-based geolocation** to fetch an approximate location and send it via Twilio SMS.  

### ðŸ”¹ Buzzer Alerts  
- Different **beep patterns** indicate:
  - Depth detection  
  - Obstacle detection
