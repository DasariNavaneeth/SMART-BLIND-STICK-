‚öôÔ∏è Features
Obstacle Detection: Ultrasonic sensor detects nearby obstacles and alerts the user through buzzer.
Depth Detection: Another ultrasonic sensor measures the depth of drop-offs or steps.
Fall Detection with Delay: Gyroscope detects if the user falls. After a 10-second delay, the GPS module sends the user‚Äôs location to family members via Twilio SMS, giving the user a chance to cancel false alarms.
Manual Location Alert: Pressing the button sends the user‚Äôs location immediately via Twilio SMS.
GPS Fallback via IP: If GPS fails to provide location, the system fetches approximate location using IP-based geolocation and sends it via Twilio SMS.
Buzzer Alerts: Different beep patterns indicate depth detection and obstacle detection.
